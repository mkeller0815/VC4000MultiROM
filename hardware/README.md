Hardware files for the MultiRom Cartridge
=========================================

You need [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org) 4.0 or later to open the project files.

The file MultiRomCard-cache.lib is included here for convenience. If you have
the KiCad standard symbol libraries installed, you do not need this file.
Currently, the only items from the standard libraries are the schematic symbols
for the 74HC595 Shift Register and the 74HC245 Bus Transciever. All other
schematic symbols are custom made and included in MultiRomCard.lib.

The Printouts folder contains PDF plots of the schematic and of the two current
PCB copper layers.  They can be used to create a double sided PCB with DIY
methods like toner transfer.
