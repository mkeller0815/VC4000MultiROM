Kicad Project for the MultiRom Cartridge
========================================

You need a recent build of the Kicad "product" branch on Launchpad to open the
project. The current "stable" version will not work.

The MultiRomCard-cache.lib is included here for convenience. If you have the
Kicad standard symbol libraries installed, you do not need this file. Currently,
the only items from the standard libraries are the schematic symbols for the
74HC595 Shift Register and the 74HC245 Bus Transciever. All other schematic
symbols are custom made and included in MultiRomCard.lib.
